# Frontend

## Description

Our frontend is a native mobile application, operating on both Android and iOS platforms.

## Built With

This section includes the technologies, libraries and tools that we used for the development of the application. We selected the ones we consider that were critical and their absence would make our project more difficult.

### Main

-   [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)   
We decided to work with React Native as it is a great way of creating multiplatform native applications. We were drawn to it partially due to the fact that there is a huge developer community that could support us whenever we needed, which is very important for a team creating its first production level application. Also, we found many great libraries that we thought could come in handy during the development of the app.

### Secondary

-   [Firebase SDK](https://firebase.google.com/)   
We utilised Firebase for a variety of tasks, such as Analytics (more details follow), performance monitoring and Deep Linking in our app. It provided us with solutions that were not available anywhere else, at a reasonable cost.

-   [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)   
We chose React Navigation as our main navigation solution as it is a widely used product, maintained by an active community of contributors and has excellent documentation for every usecase.


-   [react-native-keychain](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-keychain)   
We used react-native-keychain as it is a reliable library that can securely store sensitive data on the users device, vital to our application's  operation.


### Analytics

-   [Firebase Analytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics)   
We used Firebase (Google) Analytics as it was easy to set up, cost effective, used by many projects similar to ours and is a product of a reliable company. We used several products of the Firebase SDK to track stats like audience, conversions, realime analytics and more technical details like performance reports and crashalytics.


### UI details 

-   [react-native-fast-image](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image)   
We enhanced our image rendering and caching with react-native-fast-image, as it provides better performance compared to React Native's Image component when loading images from a remote source.

-   [react-native-reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/)   
Since our application needed custom Gesture Animations, we utilised the react-native-reanimated library as well as React Native's [Animated](https://reactnative.dev/docs/animated) library and [react-native-gesture-handler](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler).

-   [lottie-react-native](https://github.com/lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native)   
We spiced our UI up by using some animations from Lottie, which provided us with a huge variety of concepts to choose from.
