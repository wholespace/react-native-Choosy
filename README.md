<!-- Introduction -->

## Introduction

Choosy is a user-based app that allows others to vote on which of your photos they think should be uploaded on your social media accounts!


[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

### App concept

Being authentic is what the internet is all about! But in a world where we take so many photos, it’s not always easy deciding which one is best! We ask for our friends’ opinions and spend hours trying to choose, often with no success.

And that’s how we got inspired to create Choosy!


-   **Create photo polls!** Don’t waste time trying to choose between two or more photos. Let our community help you!
-   **Get real opinions from real users!** Don’t limit yourself to just a few friends. Choosy gives you the ability to collect feedback from a variety of people, each with their own unique way of thinking.
-   **Be active and help others decide!** Just like you, other users also appreciate help! Select the pictures that you think will get the most likes. Your opinion counts!
-   **Find the best photo!** After your polls expire, only the best voted photos remain. The only thing you have to do is upload them on your social media accounts and stun your followers and friends!
